# LuxuraBuild

LuxuraBuild is a **simple, local draw sheet tool** for construction offices.  
It reduces manual typing by auto-filling subcontractor information and lets office staff build draw sheets quickly in the browser.

This tool is designed for **internal use only** and runs entirely on your local machine.
